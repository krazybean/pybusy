# pybusy
Based off of cli-spinners

This was gonna be something until I found out something already existed and does a better job, so i guess this is for me

### Example usage:

```
from pybusy import cursors
print(cursors.cursor_list())
>>> ['dots', 'dots2', 'dots3', 'dots4'...
cursors.animate('dots2', color='yellow')
â ‹
```

### Colors are dependent on ansicolors

have fun
